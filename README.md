**How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?**

This class focused on creating java code and JUnit testing to test for deficiencies within that code. The JUnit test results were then used to assess where my code stands and what areas needed more work. By encapsulating the code, JUnit testing was simple, quick and reusable.

**How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?**

I start by identifying functional and non-functional requirements that the user wants. Asking myself specific questions helps to interpret what the needs are. Sometimes when the requirements are complicated or overwhelming, creating a simple diagram to organize the requirements into a simplier form. 

**How do I approach designing software?**

Approaching software design in an object oriented manner helps to create clean and well organized code. Principles such as classes, encapsulation, inheritance and polymorphism are all required in OOP design.
